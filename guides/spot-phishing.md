# How to spot phishing and stay safe online

Phishing is when someone tries to trick you into giving personal information.

Watch for:

- Unexpected messages asking you to click a link or share details
- Spelling mistakes and urgent threats (“act now!”)
- Strange sender addresses or web addresses

What to do:

- Don’t click suspicious links. Go directly to the official website/app.
- Call the company using the number on their official site (not from the message).
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).
