# What is an OTP and why it matters

An OTP (one-time password) is a short code sent to you to confirm it’s really you.

- It usually comes by SMS, email, or an authenticator app.
- You should enter it only on trusted websites/apps you initiated.
- Never share an OTP with anyone on a phone call or chat.

Why it’s important:

- OTPs help protect your accounts even if someone knows your password.
- Scammers often ask for OTPs to take over accounts.

Tips:

- If you get an OTP you didn’t request, ignore it.
- Use authenticator apps (Google Authenticator) when possible.
